WHAT I CHANGED:
1. I fixed the indexing issues that had to do with my move draw, it would add the last of the
draw pile to the front of the visible instead of adding the first in the invisible
2. I got rid of the public field in the controller, even though I only used it for testing and it
never affected any of the other code
3. I put all my basic klondike implementation into an abstract klondike class, basically setting
the basic klondike as the default game method and any other model would need to override each method
as needed.
4. Added a current state and current score field in the controller, so that I can still output the
game state after the game is over because before it would just crash
